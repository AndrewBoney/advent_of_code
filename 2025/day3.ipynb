    "\n",
    "1. Start from the left\n",
    "2. At each position, pick the largest available digit that still leaves enough digits to reach 12 total\n",
    "\n",

    "- Pick the `9` (1st digit, 11 more needed, 14 digits remain ✓)\n",
    "- Pick the `8` (2nd digit, 10 more needed, 13 digits remain ✓)\n",
